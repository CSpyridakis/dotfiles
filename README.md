# dotfiles

🗒️ General Notes
This repository contains a personal collection of dotfiles, collected over the years, related to different tools.

💡 Purpose
The idea is to collect my configurations in one place and provide easy access to them from different devices. This way, in case of a disaster, I am not tied to a single system. Instead, I can easily configure any system to behave the way I am used to.

💬 What should I expect?
You might find ideas or solutions to problems you also face regarding your dotfiles.

I am a big fan of TMUX as well. For this reason, my TMUX dotfiles are available in their own [repository](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/tmux-monitor-theme), where the tmux theme I created is also available.

❓ After that?
If you have any further questions or need help with another topic, feel free to create a pull request.
